       "\"<sos> one of the other reviewers has mentioned that after watching just 1 oz episode you 'll be hooked . <eos> <sos> they are right , as this is exactly what happened with me . <eos> <sos> the first thing that struck me about oz was its brutality and unflinching scenes of violence , which set in right from the word go . <eos> <sos> trust me , this is not a show for the faint hearted or timid . <eos> <sos> this show pulls no punches with regards to drugs , sex or violence . <eos> <sos> its is hardcore , in the classic use of the word . <eos> <sos> it is called oz as that is the nickname given to the oswald maximum security state penitentary . <eos> <sos> it focuses mainly on emerald city , an experimental section of the prison where all the cells have glass fronts and face inwards , so privacy is not high on the agenda . <eos> <sos> em city is home to many .. aryans , muslims , gangstas , latinos , christians , italians , irish and more .... <eos> <sos> so scuffles , death stares , dodgy dealings and shady agreements are never far away . <eos> <sos> i would say the main appeal of the show is due to the fact that it goes where other shows would n't dare . <eos> <sos> forget pretty pictures painted for mainstream audiences , forget charm , forget romance ... <eos> <sos> oz does n't mess around . <eos> <sos> the first episode i ever saw struck me as so nasty <eos> <sos> it was surreal <eos> <sos> , i could n't say i was ready for it , but as i watched more , i developed a taste for oz , and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence . <eos> <sos> not just violence , but injustice ( crooked guards who 'll be sold out for a nickel , inmates who 'll kill on order and get away with it , <eos> <sos> well mannered , middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of street skills or prison experience ) watching oz <eos> <sos> , you may become comfortable with what is uncomfortable viewing .... thats if you can get in touch with your darker side . <eos>\""
